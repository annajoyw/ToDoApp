# ToDoApp
Thank you for taking the time to review my project. This ToDo app was created specifically for Winona IT as part of the technical interview process.

# Features
The features of this app include:
- adding ToDo Item
- adding child Item to a ToDo
- marking Item/Child Item as complete
- removing Item/Child Item from a list
- setting deadline for ToDo item

# Technology Used
- ASP.Net Core v6
- Blazor

# Running the App
For this project to run as intended, you will need to set both the ToDoApp and ToDoWebAPI as the startup projects. Directions for how to do this can be found [here](https://learn.microsoft.com/en-us/visualstudio/ide/how-to-set-multiple-startup-projects?view=vs-2022)
